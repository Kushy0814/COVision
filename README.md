# COVision: A Novel CNN for the Differentiation of COVID-19 From Common Pulmonary Conditions (ROBO052T)

With the growing amount of COVID-19 cases, especially in developing countries with limited medical resources, itâ€™s essential to accurately diagnose COVID-19 with high specificity. Due to characteristic ground-glass opacities (GGOs), present in both COVID-19 and other acute lung diseases, misdiagnosis occurs often in manual interpretations of CT scans. Current deep learning models can identify COVID-19 but cannot distinguish it from other common lung diseases like bacterial pneumonia. COVision is a novel multi-classification convolutional neural network (CNN) that can differentiate COVID-19 from other common lung diseases, with a low false-positivity rate.

CT Scans of COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy patients were obtained from the China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investigation (CC-CCII) dataset: http://ncov-ai.big.ac.cn/download?lang=en. Ground truth for the CC-CCII dataset was established via serology tests and confirmed by laboratory findings. Clinical factors for COVID-19, and pneumonia patients were obtained from the Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/COVID-19_and_non-COVID-19_pneumonia_Dataset/16682422. Clinical factors for healthy patients were obtained from Israeli Ministry of Health public dataset: https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19/resource/74216e15-f740-4709-adb7-a6fb0955a048.
